# unnamed-debate-tool
This project is an attempt to build a cohesive piece of software that helps ease the process of researching and presenting evidence in highschool and college debate.

## Compilation
You will need to have maven installed, as well as of course a JDK (>=JDK 9). Then you should be able to build an executable jar by running ```mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Djdk.gtk.version=2 prepare-package package```.
